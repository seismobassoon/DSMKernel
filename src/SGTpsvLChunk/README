this project is to accelerate the SGT computation at the maximal speed, 
erasing some trivial if clauses, 
computing for the highest l demanded (which takes more time but necessary for near-field wavefield),
and preparing spherical harmonics for all the points in advance (~42 Gb for 0.1 degree spacing)
