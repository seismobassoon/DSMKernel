Hi! ðŸ‘‹
Here is the python graphical interface for the DSM Kernel. It is a interactive map that enables to select seismic stations with events from the catalog IRIS and directly download the data 
(xml file, and sac/mseed for the seismic trace). The first goal is to be able to compute faster and easier the synthetic seismograms for any teleseismic event thanks to the DSM Kernel algorithm.

_(information of the utilisation are coming...)_
