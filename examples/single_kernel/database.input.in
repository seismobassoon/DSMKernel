! This is a new input file for SGTpsv and SGTsh (DSM2022)
! To comment out, you can use ! or # or just tab or spaces

	Now the order is completely free 

	However, the variable delcaration should be start from the first string of line

DSMconfFile = ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/etc/DSMconfiguration/DSM.config

modelname = ak135

outputDir = ${SGT_ROOT} 

psvmodel = ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/etc/models/ak135.psv.model

tlen = 819.2d0

	tlen is preferred to be set as powers of 2 time 0.1 seconds to be sampled safely at 20 Hz

radiiQ = 3491.d0 6371.d0 20.d0

	radiiQ needs three radii in km for min, max and delta for points to compute strains

epicentralDistancesQ = 0.d0 180.d0 2.5d-1
	
	epicentralDistancesQ needs three angles in degrees for min, max and delta 
	for points to compute strains


radiusSource = 6157.d0
	

shortestPeriod = 3.2d0

	shortestPeriod is indeed the shortest period to compute: that is, the filter should be 
	applied longer than this period to avoid boxcar window in frequency domain 



	It is not recommended to change the parameters below and for your own SGT generation, 
	you are even not obliged to specify these parameters!!!
	
	imin = 0 

	imin is the start frequency index which can be non zero for high-frequency focused tomography

	imax = 256

	imax is the max frequency index (in integer) and tlen/imax should be the shortest period
	pinputDatabaseFile will give priority to  imin and imax pairs (even imin is not declared)
 	with respect to  shortestPeriod above

	rsgtswitch = 1
	tsgtswitch = 1
	synnswitch = 1
	psgtswitch = 1


maxMemoryInGigabyte = 2.d0

!!!! Below are the configuration parameters that you do not want to touch normally
	re = 1.d-2 
	this is the relative error (see GT95 eq. 6.2)

	ratc = 1.d-10
	amplitude ratio used in grid cut-off

	ratl = 1.d-5
	amplitude ratio used in l-cutoff that I will not use 

	omegai = 1.d-2
	wrap-around attenuation for omegai (usually 1.d-2 is used)

	maxlmax = 80000

	deltalwindow = 500
